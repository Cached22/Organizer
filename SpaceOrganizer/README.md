# SpaceOrganizer

SpaceOrganizer is a mobile-compatible web application designed to help users organize a space, such as a garage, by taking a picture, recognizing items, and suggesting an optimal arrangement using advanced object recognition and space optimization algorithms.

## Project Overview

The app allows users to:

- Take a picture of their space.
- Recognize items within the space using object recognition technology.
- Generate and visualize an optimal arrangement for the recognized items.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native (for mobile) or React.js (for web)
- **Backend**: Flask or Django
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Object Recognition**: Google Cloud Vision API or OpenCV
- **Optimization Algorithms**: SciPy, OR-Tools
- **Visualization**: Plotly/Dash
- **Machine Learning (if needed)**: TensorFlow, PyTorch

1. Open the app in your web browser or mobile device.
2. Register or log in to your account.
3. Take a picture of your space using the app interface.
4. Upload the image and wait for the app to recognize items.
5. Enter the dimensions of your space if prompted.
6. View the suggested optimal arrangement visualized on the screen.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

Run unit tests for the backend:
```
cd backend
pytest
```

Run unit tests for the frontend:
```
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Integration Testing

Ensure that the backend and frontend are correctly integrated by running the following:
```
cd backend
pytest tests/integration/
```

### End-to-End Testing

For end-to-end testing, use the following command:
```
cd frontend
npm run e2e
```

## Deployment

The backend can be deployed to a cloud service such as Heroku or AWS. Ensure that you have set up the necessary environment variables and configurations before deployment.
